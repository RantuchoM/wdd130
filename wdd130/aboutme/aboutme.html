    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is <i>Martín Rantucho</i> and I'm living in Viedma, Río Negro, Argentina. I'm 33 years old, and I have an 8-years-old daughter and an 1.5 years-old son.</p>
    <h3>Previous studies</h3>
    <p>I'm a certified music-therapist in Argentina, and I've worked in several institutions in Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca; but I've started working remote in-between the pandemics in order to take care of my newborn child; and I've developed a taste and preference for this kind of flexible work and it encouraged my pre-existing passion for PCs and development</p>
    <h3>BYU-Idaho</h3>
    <p>In 2020 I've started and finished BYU-Pathway with the intention of studying economics and marketing; but had to stop my studies since we moved to a new city with kids, and my wife works in an orchestra that does gigs all along our province. Now I've decided that it's time to continue learning and developing new skills centered in the Gospel!</p>
    <p>I hope to learn a lot from you!</p>
